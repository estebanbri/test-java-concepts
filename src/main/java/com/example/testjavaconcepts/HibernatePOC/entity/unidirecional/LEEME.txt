Unidirectional Relationships
In a unidirectional relationship, only one entity has a relationship field or property
that refers to the other. For example, LineItem would have a relationship field that
identifies Product, but Product would not have a relationship field or property for LineItem.
In other words, LineItem knows about Product, but Product doesnâ€™t know which LineItem
instances refer to it.
